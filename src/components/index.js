// A file where I can export all of the components I have written
// so once I import this file, It imports all of my react components
// Now I know I only have to import this 1 file in my App.js to work with all of my react components
// Remember, I am using an export default only because I know that only the Nav, Bio, and Gallery function is what I wrote in them respective files.
export { default as Nav } from "./Nav";
export { default as Bio } from "./Bio";
export { default as Gallery } from "./Gallery";
